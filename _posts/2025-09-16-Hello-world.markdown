First blog post in about 20 years. I've just made this quick site in Jekyll as a landing page for some dev work and maybe the occasional blog post. It'll also serve as a much better domain name for sharing things, and hosting projects than my previous one which wasn't exactly professional.

Just learning the basics of Jekyll; it all seems all pretty simple so far, which is exactly what I was after. Something I can use to bash a few pages out with very little thought, just need to remember my markup..
